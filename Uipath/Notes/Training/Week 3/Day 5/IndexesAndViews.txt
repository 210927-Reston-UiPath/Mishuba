Indexes & Views

What is an Indexes
- Structure or object that retrieve specific rows or data
- Can be created using one or more columns
- Can also be sued by partial data depending on query requirement conditions
- Different types of Indexes:
    B-tree
    Hash
    Gist
        *SP-Gist
    GIN
    BRIN

Special Types of Indexes
- Different types of Indexes
    - B-tree    
        - stands for "balanced tree" and is a type of index that cna be created in relational databases
        - Hash - Hash indexes support only single-column indexes and do not allow uniqueness checking.

        Hash indexes support only the = operator, so WHERE clauses that specify range operations will not be able to take advantage of hash indexes. Most commonly used in Data Management
       (gather more notes) GIST - A GIST index is lossy, meaning that the index might produce



        CREATE UNIQUE INDEX alsdktj;as On sadljk

        CREATE INDEX sakdj;lkjs;d USING GIN asdsa

        CREATE INDEX On

WHY Index
- 

Why Not Index
- There are times when indexes should be avoided
- Indexes should not be used on small tables
-

Fill-Factor
- The fill-actor option is provided for fine-tuning index data storage and performance.
- Fill-factor value determines the percentage of space on each leaf-level page to be filled with data
- Reserving the remainder on each page as free space or future growth 
- The empty space is reserved beween the index rows rather than at the end of the index.

HOW Index
- We can list indexes from a POstgreSQL database by using either pg_indexes view or psql command
    - Create Index - shows you how to deine a new index for a table
    - Drop Index - guides you on how to remove an existing index
    - List indexes - shows you hwo to list all indexes in the PostgreSQL database
    - Index Types - discuess various types of indexes in PostgreSQL
    - Unique Index - provides you with steps on defining unique indexes
    - Index on Experssion - shows you how to define an index based on expressions
    - Partial index - illustrates 

What are Views?
- PostgresSQL Views are psendo-table
- Is based on one or more tables
- Can have all 
- Storing specalized results

Why Views
- Suppose we have a detailed SELECT statement with specific clauses that is to be used multiple times.
-

HOW Views
- The PostgreSQL views are created using tables

    - A way to optimize data retrieval
    - A way to use keys



Be careful because they take up a ton of space.
