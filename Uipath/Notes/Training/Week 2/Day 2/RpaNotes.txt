What is RPA?
    -Robotic Process Automation is the technology that enables sofftware 'robots' to carry out repetitive, rule-based digital tasks.
    - Helpful because
        - They do not get tired
        - They help eliminate mistakes
        - they help you free up time.

Processes That are perfect for RPA
- A process is a set of interrelated or interacting activities that transforms inputs into outputs.
- Processes have 4 components: inputs, process flows, source applications, and outputs
- 2 criteria for automation potential: process fitness & automation complexity
- Process fitness   
    - Determines how fit a process is for automation
    - check if your process is: rule-based, repetitive, standard input, stable
        - is it moving
        - are there set guidelines for it.
        - rule based

- Automation complexity
    - How hard it is to automate a process
    - Check: Number of screens, types of applications, business logic scenarios, types and number of inputs.    
      - Smaller the number of inputs the better
      - 

- UiPath Ecosystem
    - UiPath Studio
        - An intergrated development environment for RPA developers to design, develop, and debug automation projects
    - Orchestrator
        - Where automated processes are published as Nuget packages 
        - (think of it as you as the bot to make a cakes and it goes to the folder and find the recipe for cakes and then makes it.)
    - robots    
        - An execution agent that runs an automation.

Types of robots
- Attended
    - might require user input 
- Unattended
    -
