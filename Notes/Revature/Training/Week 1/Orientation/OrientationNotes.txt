Agile Methodology
	Mainly Scrum
		Implementation of agile methodology
		Characterized by daily standups (aka scrum meetings), sprints, scrum masters and scrum boards.
		Ever continous


	Everyone literally stands up and talks about 3 things:
1.) Achievements
	what they achieved since the last stand up 
2.) Goals
	Waht they're planning on doing till the next stand up
3.) Blockers
	Anything that's keeping them rom achieving their goals
A scrum master facilitates these daily meetings


Sprints
The time a team has for developing their next deliverable
No standard set time (usually 2-6 weeks
4 phases:
	1.) Sprint Planning
	2.) Sprint proper
	3.) Sprint Review
	4.) Sprint retrospective

Other Scrum Artifacts
Scrum board
	Where your user stories live
Burdown chart
	Visualization of the velocity of the sprint
	How many points were accomplished in the sprint
