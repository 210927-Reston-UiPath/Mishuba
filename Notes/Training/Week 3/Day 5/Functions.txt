SQL FUnctions

Functions are read only

- A function is a set of SQL statemnets that perform a speciic task

- Functions can be created in a language of your choice like SQL, PL/pgSqL, C, Python, etc

- FUnctions foster code reusability, if you have to repeatedly write large SQl scripts to perorm the same task, you can create a function that performs that task. Next time instead of rewriting the SQL, you can simply call that function. A function accepts inputs in the form

SQL Aggregate vs Scalar FUnctions
- SQL Agrregate functions return a single value, calcuated from values in a column
- SQL Scalar functions return a single value, based on the input value.
