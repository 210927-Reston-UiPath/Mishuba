1.) Start teh project as a 'Sequence' and drag a 'State Machine' activity inside it.

2.) Create a State ("Select initial amount") and link it to the Start. In the 'Entry' section.
    -Use an 'Input Dialog' activity to get the user input. Define the options as an array in the designated field in the Properites panel: {"$5", "$10", "20"}. Store the output under a new variable ("ChosenAmount");
    -Use an 'If' activity and set 'ChosenAmount IsNotNothing' as Condition.
    In the 'Then' section, drag another 'Sequence' adn insert an 'Assign' activity to convert the amount into Int32 using the name it "CurrentAmount". In the expression value field, type 'Cint(ChosenAmount.Replace("$",""))'.
3.) Define a new Dicitonary variable name "DrinkPrice" to store the prices for the individual drinks. Type the following expression in the 'Default' value field of the dictionary variable type:

New Dicitonary (Of String,Int32) From {{"Coffee - $3", 3},{"Tea - $2",2}}

4. Create a new State ("Choose product") and in the 'Entry' section of the State:
    -Use an 'Input Dialog' to display the drink options and let the user choose. In the 'Options' expression value ield, under 'input', type "{"Coffee - $3", "Tea - $2"}". The outpu should be stored under a new variable ("ChosenDrink");
    -Use an "If" activity with the Condition "CurrentAmount>=DrinkPrice(ChosenDrink)":
        * If 'True' ("Then" section), use an 'Assign' to calculate the "currentAmount" by subtracting the price of the drink ("CurrentAmount-DrinkPrice(ChosenDrink)").

        Use an 'Input Dialog' to display the remaining amount inside the "Input Label" field ("String.Format("Done! your current credit ${0}. What do you want to do next?", CurrentAmount.ToString)") and allow the user to choose between buying a new drink and requesting the change. Store the outcome in a new variable ("NextAction").

        Insert and 'if' activity and type "NextActionIsNothing Or NextAction.Equals("Get change")" in the Condition field.
        If "True", use an 'Assign' activity to assign the value 'True' to a global Boolean variable ("GetChange"). Be aware that you don't need the 'Else' section within this particular activity.

        *If 'False' ('Else' section), display a corresponding message in a 'Message Box' and use an "Assign' to change the value of "GetChange" to 'True'.

5.) Create a 'final State ("Give change and Exit"). In the 'Entry' section, use a 'Message Box' to display the value of the "CurrentAmount" variable.

6.) Create the following Transitions:
    - From "Select initial amount" State to "Choose product" State with the "Cndition - ChosenAmountIsNotNothing"
    - From "Select initial amount" State to "Give change and Exit" State with the "Condition - ChosenAmountIsNOthing"
    - A self-transition, from "Choose product" State to "Choose product" State with the Condition - Not GetChange
    - From "Choose product" State to "Give change and Exit" State, with the Condition- Get Change.
