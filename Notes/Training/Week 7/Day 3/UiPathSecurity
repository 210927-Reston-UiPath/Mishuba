Code review aims to ensure that the process that will run on live data is safe and no security breaches are possible
In what areas of workflow automation do you think code review has an impact?
    * Code review is very useful to ensure the proper usage o credentials, as it will check whether the credentials are used only where needed and are not passed outside the trusted environment.
    * Sharing data outside the environment is a common thing in automation, by saving files, sending emails, or other interactions with external systems.
    *Code review can prevent sending sensitive data outsdie the trusted scope.
    * Accounts or email addresses are sometimes written in the code, and thus may raise security threats.
    * A malicious developer can utilize his own details to receive money or information overriding conigurable settings, but code review can prevent such events.
