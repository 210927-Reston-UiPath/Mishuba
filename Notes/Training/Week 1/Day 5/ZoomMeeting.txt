imperative Knowledge:

    How to find the sqrt of x
        1 Guess a number < x, known as Guess
        2 put it in x = g^2
        3. if that is x, stop
        4. if it is > x, guess a lower number
        5. if it is < x, guess a higher number.

In act the engine may be described as being the material expression of any indefinite function of any degree of generality and complexity.
                Science of operations, constructed with peculiar reference to abstract number as the subject of those operations.
                    but the science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself.
