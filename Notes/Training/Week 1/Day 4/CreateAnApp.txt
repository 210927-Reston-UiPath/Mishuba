# Creating a console app
1. Using the dotnet new command create a new console app in vb  
    * Run 'dotnet new console --language vb -o <Name of your application>'
    '--language' is a flag for letting the cli know that you want to use vb syntax
    '-o' is a flag for letting the cli know that you want that project in a specific folder
2. Create a .gitignore file or ignoring build output
    -Run 'dotnet new gitignore;
    -OR you can create your own gitignore file, go to gitignore.io and copy what it give you in the gile you just created.
